# ðŸŒ²

An URL manipulation library that supports URL records, relative URLs, reference resolution and a number of other elementary operations on URLs in a way that is compatible with the [WHATWG URL Standard][wwg].

This library serves as a reference implementation for this [URL Specification][url-spec], which is an alternative URL specification that rephrases and generalises the WHATWG URL Standard to add support for relative URLs, reference resolution and a number of other elementary operations.

API
---

The library exposes a concise, low-level API for working with URL strings and URL records. It models URLs as plain javascript objects and it exposes a number of _functions_ for working with them.

It does not aim to provide an object oriented API. Such interfaces can easily be created on top of this library, if so desired.

### URLs

In this implementation URLs are modeled as plain JavaScript objects with the following _optional_ attributes:

* **scheme**, **user**, **pass**, **host**, **port**, **drive**, **root**, **dirs**, **file**, **query**, **hash**

Here, **dirs**, if present is an non-empty array of strings and all other attributes are strings. The string valued attributes are subject to the constraints as described in the specification.

### Predicates

* isBase (url)
* isResolved (url)

### Reference Resolution

* ord (url)
* upto (url, ord)
* goto (url1, url2 [, options])
* preResolve (url1, url2)
* resolve (url1, url2)
* force (url)
* forceResolve (url1, url2)

### Normalisation

* normalise (url), normalize (url)
* percentEncode (url)
* percentDecode (url)

### Parsing and Printing

* modes
* modeFor (url)
* parse (string [, mode])
* parseAuth (string [, mode])
* parseHost (string [, mode])
* print (url)

### Host processing

* ipv4
  * parse (string)
  * print (number)
  * normalise (string)
* ipv6
  * parse (string)
  * print (num-array)
  * normalise (string)


Notes on the Specification
--------------------------

The [URL Specification][url-spec] models URLs as [ordered sequences of tokens][url-spec-model], with at most one token per type, except for **dir** tokens, of which it may have any amount. Futhermore, the **username**, **password**, **host** and **port** are nested inside an **authority** token. This representation is a good fit for the specification.

For implementations however it makes sense to model URLs as records, or in the case of this library, as plain JavaScript objects. The **dir** tokens, if present, are collected into a **dirs** array and the **authority**, if present, is flattened by setting any of its **user**, **pass**, **host** and **port** constituents directly on the url object itself. Such records are in one-to-one correspondence with the sequences of tokens as defined in the URL specification.
