URL Implementation 
==================

# üå≤

An URL manipulation library that supports URL records, relative URLs, reference resolution and a number of other elementary operations on URLs in a way that is compatible with the [WHATWG URL Standard].

This library serves as a reference implementation for this [URL Specification], which is an alternative URL specification that rephrases and generalises the WHATWG URL Standard to add support for relative URLs, reference resolution and a number of other elementary operations, as wel as restoring a formal grammar. 

**Please consider using the latest version**, even if released under a -dev prerelease flag. The API is stabilising, but I am still making small changes. 
Always feel free to ask questions. If you wish, you may file an issue for a question.

People are encouraged to experiment with creating more high level APIs around this library. One example is my [reurl] library, which wraps around spec-url to provide a high level API for immutable URL objects.

API
---

The library exposes a concise, low-level API for working with URL strings and URL records. It models URLs as plain javascript objects and it exposes a number of _functions_ for working with them.

### URL

In this implementation an URL is modeled as a plain JavaScript object with the following _optional_ attributes:

* **scheme**, **user**, **pass**, **host**, **port**, **drive**, **root**, **dirs**, **file**, **query**, **hash**

If present, **dirs** is an non-empty array of strings; **host** is a _Host_ (see below) and all other attributes are strings. The string valued attributes are subject to the constraints as described in my [URL Specification].

A _Host_ is either an ipv6 address, a domain, an ipv4 address, or an opaque host. In this implementation these are modeled as an array of numbers, an array of strings, a number, or a string, respectively.

### Rebase

* ords ‚Äî { scheme, auth, drive, root, dir, file, query, hash }
* ord (url)
* upto (url, ord)
* rebase (url1, url2)
* goto (url2, url1) ‚Äî aka. rebase (url1, url2)

### Forcing

Forcing is used to coerce an URL to an absolute URL. Absolute URLs always have a scheme, but absolute file- and web-URLs have additional, more specific features. The force operation tries to meet those requirements, or throws an error otherwise.

* forceAsFileUrl (url)
* forceAsWebUrl (url)
* force (url)

### Resolution

* hasOpaquePath (url)
* genericResolve (url1, url2) ‚Äî RFC 3986 _strict_ resolution.
* legacyResolve (url1, url2) ‚Äî RFC 3986 _non-strict_ resolution.
* WHATWGResolve (url1, url2)
* resolve (url1, url2) ‚Äî aka. WHATWGResolve

### Normalisation

* normalise (url) ‚Äî aka. normalize
* percentEncode (url)
* percentDecode (url)

### Parsing

* modes ‚Äî { generic, web, file, noscheme }
* modeFor (url, fallback)
* parse (string [, mode])
* parseAuth (string)
* parseHost (string-or-host)
* parseWebHost (string-or-host)
* validateOpaqueHost (string)

### Printing

* print (url)
* printHost (host)
* pathname (url)
* filePath (url) ‚Äî returns a filesystem‚Äìpath-string
* unsafePrint (url)

### Host Parsing

* ipv4
  * parse (string)
  * print (number)
  * normalise (string)
* ipv6
  * parse (string)
  * print (num-array)
  * normalise (string)

### Parse Resolve and Normalise

* WHATWGParseResolve (string, base-string)
* parseResolve (string, base-string) ‚Äî aka. WHATWGParseResolve


A Note - URL Objects
--------------------

The [URL Specification] models URLs as [ordered sequences of components][URL Model], "with at most one component per type, except for **dir** componens, of which it may have any amount". Futhermore, the **username**, **password**, **host** and **port** are nested inside an **authority** component.

This representation works well for the specification. But for implementations it makes sense to model URLs as records or objects instead. 

In this this library URLs are modeled as plain JavaScript objects. The **dir** componens, if present, are collected into a single **dirs** _array_, and the **authority**, if present, is expanded by setting any of its **user**, **pass**, **host** and **port** constituents directly on the url object itself. 

There is a one-to-one correspondence between this representation and sequences of componens as defined in the URL specification.

Changelog
---------

### Version 2.3.1-dev

- Corrects a mistake where scheme-less URLs were in fact not handled as suggested in the latest release notes.
- The parser no longer enforces that web-URLs have a non-empty host, this is enforced just before resolution only.

### Version 2.3.0-dev

Towards a simple API without modes; towards loosening the constraints on the model a bit, and enforcing them in the resolution operation:

- The goto (url2, url1) operation has been renamed to **rebase** (url1, url2).
- Scheme-less URLs are now separated out to use a default **noscheme** mode.
- Scheme-less URLs are now always percent-encoded akin to special URLs.
- The model for the host has changed to distinguish between a domain, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address and an opaque host. 
- The authority parser has been rewritten.
- Forcing and host parsing has been refactored.
- The authority constraints on file- and web-URLs are enforced in the force operation.

### Version 2.2.0-dev

- Exports unsafePrint, pathname and filePath functions.
- Exports parseResolve as an alias for WHATWGParseResolve.
- Exports an errors (obj) functon to return a list of violated structural constraints, if any.
- Catch up with WHATWG changes: C0-control and DEL codepoints are no longer allowed in domains.
- Prevent reparse bugs for relative URLs that start with  a scheme-like dir or file component.
- Fix a regression where non-character codepoints were not correctly percent encoded.

### Version 2.1.0-dev

- Refactored the percent coding, making it possible to convert URL-objects to a valid URI (RFC3986), a _valid_ URL, or as specified by the WHATWG, to a normalised but potentially invalid URL.
- Catching up with WHATWG changes: the host parser will now raise an error on domains that end in a number.
- Removed the _isBase_ method in favour of an _hasOpaquePath_ method.

### Version 2.0.0-dev.1

- Changes to the API for forcing and reference resolution.
- A fix for normalisation of opaque-path-URL that resulted in a difference in behaviour with the WHATWG Standard. 

### Version 1.5.0

- Includes both a CommonJS version and an ES Module. üåø
- Includes various changes from the 2.x.x-dev versions:
- Exports the pathname and unsafePrint functions.
- Exports parseResolve as an alias for WHATWGParseResolve.
- The host parser will now raise an error on domains that end in a number.
- Includes a fix for normalisation of opaque-path-URL that resulted in a difference in behaviour with the WHATWG Standard. 
- Prevents reparse bugs for scheme-less URLs that start with a scheme-like path component.


### Version 1.4.0

- Converted the project from a CommonJS module to an EcmaScript module
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This should have been considered a breaking change. 

### Version 1.3.0

- Use strict resolution for generic URLs, in accordance with the WHATWG standard. 
- Expose a strictness option on the resolve operations.

### Version 1.2.0

- Expose a WHATWGParseResolve (string, base-string) to work similar to the WHATWG URL constructor ‚Äî new URL (string, base-string).
